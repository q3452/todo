## TO DO list

This is a Cinnamon Desklet, in its early stages.
It is intended to support a checkable TO DO list in the first instance and develop into a GTD-style task management utility in the future.

It is just barely feature-complete but is quite usable in its current state, it has mostly been used to test Cinnamon extension techniques due to the dearth of documentation on this.
